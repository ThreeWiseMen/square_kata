Square Kata
-----------

This is one example of a test-driven Object Oriented emergent solution to the Square kata written in the Ruby programming language.

The Square kata is as follows:

Take a parameter n. If n is a perfect square (ie. sqrt(n) is an integer) then output a matrix sqrt(n) x sqrt(n) in size, which contains the sequence 1..n drawn
spirally from the centre of the matrix counter-clockwise. Here are a few illustrative examples:

Input:  1
Output: 1

Input:  4
Output: 4 3
        1 2

Input:  9
Output: 5 4 3
        6 1 2
        7 8 9

Input:  16
Output: 16 15 14 13
        5  4  3  12
        6  1  2  11
        7  8  9  10
